## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#310](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/310) [`bbdef97`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/bbdef97d8a1eb77a3864291918f7f5aace559ff2) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Decouple the build-volume **wireframe cage** from the bed/plate ([#306](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/306) item 6). The cage (the box up to
  the volume height) is now independently toggleable: a new `controls.setBuildVolumeCage(visible)` and a
  `showVolumeCage` prop across all four adapters (`show-volume-cage` attribute on the element), plus a
  `BuildVolumeStyle.showCage` option. Default `true` (unchanged look); set `false` to show only the
  printable bed/plate without the whole machine-volume cage. The 2D renderer treats it as a documented
  no-op. Toggling flips the named `volumeCage` object in place (no geometry rebuild).

- [#313](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/313) [`39ede6e`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/39ede6ebc0a1ba594a391f1b33db2bdf3445d414) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Frame-to-content: frame the printed **object**, not the skirt/prime ([#306](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/306) item 6). New
  `ToolpathIR.objectBounds` (extrusion of labeled objects only, `segments.object != 0`; empty when the
  file has no object labels) and a `frameContent: 'object' | 'all'` option threaded through the renderer
  (`setFrameContent`), `renderStill`, and all four adapters (`show-`-style `frame-content` attribute on the
  element). Default `'all'` (unchanged framing). `'object'` frames only the printed objects so a prime
  line or skirt at the bed edge no longer shrinks the object in view; when the file carries no object
  labels it discloses (an `E_FRAME_CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE` event) and frames all extrusion — never fabricated.

  Note: `frameContent: 'object'` engages only when the parser populated the `objects` capability (M486 /
  EXCLUDE_OBJECT / `; printing object`). Broadening object-label detection for more slicer/firmware
  variants is tracked separately.

- [#314](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/314) [`caaa0fa`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/caaa0fad0938bfa3ac1cd9f312f9cd2355c722d1) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Interaction-aware render quality ([#306](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/306) item 2, DD-020). New opt-in `interactionQuality: 'off' | 'auto'`
  renderer option + `controls.setInteractionQuality` + an `interactionQuality` prop / `interaction-quality`
  attribute on all four adapters. With `'auto'`, the renderer **reduces render detail (pixel ratio) while
  the camera is moving and restores full detail when it settles** (short debounce), so orbiting a heavy tube
  scene stays responsive without permanently dropping to lines. The reduction is proactive (a gesture starts
  at 0.6× the resting pixel ratio) and adapts to measured frame time within a clamped `[0.4, 1]` band. The
  hard vertex-budget `quality-fallback` (tubes → lines when a chunk can't allocate) is unchanged as the final
  safety net. **Default `'off'` — existing behavior is byte-identical.** The 2D renderer treats it as a
  documented no-op.

  A consumer maps a High / Balanced / Performance preference on top: High = `quality:'tubes'` +
  `interactionQuality:'auto'`; Balanced = `quality:'auto'` + `interactionQuality:'auto'`; Performance =
  `quality:'lines'`.

### Minor Changes

- [#300](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/300) [`277e148`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/277e1481ba015d6d0fa8d5b4e5ff6c7e014d494b) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add `framingFromCenterRadius` (and the `Framing` type) — the first piece of the shared render "stage"
  (DD-018 Phase 0). This is the deterministic 3/4 camera-framing pose (printer→scene coordinates,
  `viewHalfHeight = 1.25·radius`, fixed offset), lifted verbatim from `ToolpathRenderer.frame()` and now
  single-sourced so the forthcoming `ModelRenderer` frames identically. Internal refactor for the toolpath
  side (framing output unchanged); additive public export.

- [#302](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/302) [`ac1e1f9`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/ac1e1f984305071db1a16fd8bbd7f1166b877d9d) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Grow the shared render "stage" (DD-018 Phase 0): move the GL type contracts `RenderTargetCanvas` and
  `GLRendererLike` into `stage.ts` (re-exported from their previous homes, so no import paths change) and
  add `createDefaultGLRenderer(canvas, { preserveDrawingBuffer, alpha, antialias })` — the default
  `WebGLRenderer` builder extracted from `ToolpathRenderer`, now single-sourced with an `alpha` option the
  forthcoming `ModelRenderer` uses for a transparent background. Refactor-only for the toolpath side
  (alpha stays false → byte-identical); additive public exports.

### Minor Changes

- [#283](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/283) [`804cafb`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/804cafb33f8f8be2617585156babf1221a856941) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Adapter surface: capabilities/warnings on `ready` + declarative `view`/`cameraState` ([#275](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/275) M3+M6)

  **M3** — the `parse-complete` / `ready` event now carries `capabilities` (the per-field confidence
  map) and `warnings` alongside `{ segments, layers, complete }`, so consumers can gate their own UI on
  capability-honesty without reaching for the raw handle.

  **M6** — the `setView`/`getCameraState`/`setCameraState` methods ([#268](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/268)) get first-class declarative
  props on all four adapters: a `view` prop (preset orientation) and a `cameraState` prop (restore),
  paired with a new **`camera-changed`** event (renderer → controller → adapters, emitted when a user
  camera interaction settles) so a `cameraState` binding round-trips. The 2D renderer keeps disclosing
  via `renderer-unsupported` rather than fabricating a pose. Behavioral-suite coverage added for the
  capabilities/warnings payload across all four adapters.

- [#270](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/270) [`bb2af7a`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/bb2af7a4b9c433ef8caf59ecb5ece51f39a8eb9e) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Preset camera views + serializable camera state ([#268](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/268))

  Adds three imperative camera methods, threaded from the renderer through `PreviewRenderer` and the
  `controls` handle into all four adapters:
  - `setView(view)` — snap to a preset orientation (`top`/`bottom`/`front`/`back`/`left`/`right`/`iso`),
    instant, preserving the active projection.
  - `getCameraState()` — read the current camera as a serializable `CameraState`
    (`{ position, target, zoom, cameraMode }`, scene coordinates); a stable contract a dashboard can
    persist.
  - `setCameraState(state)` — restore a snapshot verbatim (no re-fit to the current model).

  New public types `CameraView` and `CameraState`. No new dependency, no IR/schema change, no animation
  (snapping is instant). The low-resource 2D renderer has no 3D pose, so it honors these as documented
  disclosures (`getCameraState()` → `null`; `setView`/`setCameraState` → `renderer-unsupported`) rather
  than fabricating a pose. Covered across all four adapters by the portable behavioral suite.

### Patch Changes

- [#269](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/269) [`b671d02`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/b671d02179ba6cf30ce9888fa4b851328852e0f1) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Camera UX polish: enable OrbitControls affordances already available ([#267](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/267))

  Turns on `zoomToCursor` (wheel zoom moves toward the pointer, not the orbit target) and derives
  `minDistance`/`maxDistance` clamps from the framed model size so the view can't dolly through the
  model or lose it at the extremes. Clamps are recomputed in `frame()`, so they track each file's
  bounds. Internal to `scene.ts` — no dependency, no public-API/adapter change; the headless
  still-render path (no OrbitControls) is unaffected.

- [#282](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/282) [`54b54fe`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/54b54fe240e5ef7edae0e03e351127de531c5069) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Keyboard-operable camera for embedded viewers (DD-004 a11y) ([#275](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/275)/M4)

  The embedded adapter canvases had `aria-label` but no `tabindex`, so they weren't focusable, and the
  renderer never enabled OrbitControls key events — only the standalone demo page was keyboard-usable.
  Now every adapter canvas is focusable (`tabindex="0"`) and the renderer enables OrbitControls keyboard
  events scoped to the canvas (arrow keys pan the view when it's focused, without hijacking the page's
  arrow keys). Keyboard operability is satisfied for embedders, not just the demo.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#254](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/254) [`5f59b77`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/5f59b7788bbb14cacfe21aaf3d7134c6ba8dcd86) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - feat: non-extrusion color modes — color-by-power + cut-vs-rapid (DD-012 phase 4, [#189](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/189))

  Two new `ColorMode`s consuming the [#189](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/189) channels (DD-012 D7):
  - **`power`** — ramps each segment's modal `toolPower` (laser power / spindle RPM, the `S` value) onto
    a color ramp, the CNC/laser counterpart to color-by-speed. Auto-ranged (`toolPowerRange`) or explicit;
    `NaN` (tool off) or a file parsed without the `toolPower` channel → fallback, never a fabricated color.
    Capability-gated on `toolPower` (the Three renderer's `isColorModeAvailable` gates it).
  - **`moveKind`** — cut-vs-rapid: productive moves (`Extrude` or `Cut`) vs rapids (`Travel`) — the
    "where the tool is actually working" view. Reads the always-present `kind` channel, so it is always
    available.

  Both flow through `createSegmentColorer`, so the Three and Canvas-2D renderers get them for free. FDM
  coloring is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#225](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/225) [`83f7db4`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/83f7db46be38477c4ff4127e250c6d6147c302ed) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add an optional **filled build-plate surface** to the 3D renderer ([#185](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/185)). The bare wireframe grid
  gains a themeable, self-drawn plate underneath it so a print reads against a bed rather than empty
  space — off by default (`bedSurface: { mode: 'none' }`), so the existing look is unchanged.
  - `Theme.bedSurface` (`BedSurface`): `mode: 'none' | 'solid'`, optional `color`, `opacity`, and a
    consumer-supplied `texture` (`ImageBitmap | HTMLCanvasElement` — never a URL, so it stays CSP-safe
    and synchronous for `renderStill`). No bundled vendor plate art (trademark + bloat).
  - The plate is an unlit plane spanning the bed, seated just below `z=0` with `depthWrite: false` so it
    never occludes the toolpath.
  - Keep-out zones from `MachineGeometry.excludedRegions` now render as amber outlines on the plate.

  Additive; no IR/geometry change and no new runtime dependency.

- [#230](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/230) [`e8f889b`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/e8f889b576ee06da4181a048724c880ae38fedee) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add a **color-by-layer-height** mode ([#179](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/179)) — the Orca/Bambu view that reveals variable-layer-height
  prints.
  - `gcode-colors`: new `ColorMode` variant `{ mode: 'layerHeight'; ramp; range?; fallback }`, plus
    `layerHeights(ir)` (per-layer Z-delta; layer 0 is its thickness from the bed; negative deltas clamp
    to 0) and `layerHeightRange(ir)` (the auto-range). Each segment is colored by its layer's height
    mapped onto the ramp. Derived purely from `ir.layers` — no new parsing.
  - `gcode-renderer-three`: re-exports `layerHeightRange`, and `isColorModeAvailable('layerHeight')` is
    **capability-gated on `layers`** — a non-planar/CNC IR (`layers: 'unavailable'`) reports the mode
    unavailable rather than collapsing every segment to one flat color.

  Additive; works through the existing rich `colorMode` prop on every adapter with no adapter change.

- [#217](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/217) [`17e9951`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/17e995123fa68274d508527261161741955b0647) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - E8 phase 1 ([#212](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/212), DD-014): the low-resource 2D renderer's foundation — two new lockstep packages and
  a boundary-preserving refactor. Additive; no IR/parser change, no change to the default (`'3d'`)
  behavior or any existing public API.
  - **`@chestnutlabs/gcode-colors`** (new): the renderer-agnostic home for the whole color subsystem
    (DD-014 D3). Exports the `ColorMode` union (`single`/`tool`/`feature`/`colorChange`/`feedrate`/
    `object`), `createSegmentColorer(ir, mode)` / `segmentColor`, `feedrateRange`, `rampColor`, and
    `RGB`. Depends only on `@chestnutlabs/toolpath-core` — no `three`, no framework. Every mode degrades
    unknown channel values to its fallback, never a fabricated color.
  - **`@chestnutlabs/gcode-renderer-2d`** (new): an opt-in Canvas 2D current-layer renderer over the
    existing `ToolpathIR` for low-GPU / low-memory / WebGL-blocked devices (DD-014 D1/D4). `LayerView2D`
    plus the pure `drawLayer` / `computeLayerFit` / `layerBounds2D` / `rgbToCss` core. Depends only on
    `toolpath-core` + `gcode-colors` — no `three`, no framework. Memory is bounded to the active layer.
  - **`@chestnutlabs/gcode-renderer-three`**: the per-segment color logic moved to `gcode-colors`;
    `colors.ts` now re-exports `ColorMode`/`RGB`/`feedrateRange` and `buildChunkColors` maps the shared
    colorer onto the Three.js vertex buffer. Public API and behavior unchanged (parity test).

- [#209](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/209) [`4cd453f`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/4cd453f88f3dcb012af67ee8ff30159e371fd91a) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Two additive color modes ([#177](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/177), [#178](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/178)) over channels the IR already parses, following the DD-009
  capability-gated `colors.ts` pattern:
  - **color-by-speed** (`{ mode: 'feedrate'; ramp; range?; fallback }`, [#177](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/177)): maps each segment's
    `feedrate` onto a color ramp — auto-ranged from the IR (pass `range` to keep the scale stable across
    files). NaN feedrate (before the first `F`) → fallback. Exposes `feedrateRange(ir)`. Gated on the
    `feedrate` capability.
  - **color-by-object** (`{ mode: 'object'; palette; fallback; only? }`, [#178](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/178)): shades by `seg.object`
    (1-based; 0 = none → fallback) from the E4 `M486`/`EXCLUDE_OBJECT` work; `only` isolates one object
    (others dimmed to fallback). Gated on the `objects` capability.

  Both degrade honestly to the fallback rather than fabricating a color, and are reachable through the
  existing `colorMode` prop on every adapter with no API change.

- [#224](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/224) [`d161e80`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/d161e802e36cc87fa27848ceef9d68cd45628760) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Source-line ↔ segment mapping ([#184](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/184)) — the "G-code debugger" surface. Additive; no IR/geometry change.
  - `toolpath-core`: framework-free primitives over `segments.srcByte` + `sourceIndex`: build a line
    index (`buildSourceLineIndex`), then `lineAtByte` / `byteRangeOfLine` / `sourceLineOfSegment`
    (segment → its 1-based source line) / `segmentAtSourceLine` (line → segment, -1 when the line
    produced none). Both directions, O(log n).
  - `gcode-renderer-three`: `ToolpathRenderer.pickSegment(ndcX, ndcY, threshold?)` raycasts the
    toolpath and returns the IR segment under a pointer (or null) — click a segment → its source line.
    The pure index-mapping helper `resolveHitSegment(mesh, vertexIndex)` is exported and unit-tested.
  - `gcode-preview-core`: `PreviewRenderer.pickSegment` (the 2D renderer returns null — no picking yet),
    reachable via `raw.renderer()`.

- [#229](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/229) [`be72283`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/be72283b20215450e8bf91b9a4eee730e98b423e) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Render slicer wipe moves as an independently toggleable layer (DD-016 phase 2, [#182](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/182)).

  Phase 1 populated `MoveKind.Wipe` from `;WIPE_START`/`;WIPE_END`; this makes those moves visible
  and toggleable:
  - **renderer-three**: wipe segments build into their own `'wipe'` geometry chunk (separate from
    travel), and `setKindVisible('wipe', …)` shows/hides them. Default visible — nothing disappears
    until a consumer opts out. Wipe geometry is exempt from travel decimation (it is sparse and the
    point is to see it).
  - **core**: `setKindVisible` widens to `'extrude' | 'travel' | 'wipe'` (new `MoveKindToggle` type).
    The 2D renderer treats `'wipe'` as a documented no-op (the flat view has no distinct wipe form).
  - **adapters** (Vue/React/Svelte/Element): a `showWipe` prop / `show-wipe` attribute (default true)
    mirrors `showTravel`.

  Additive and backward-compatible; existing callers passing `'extrude'`/`'travel'` are unaffected.
  Completes [#182](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/182).

### Minor Changes

- [#171](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/171) [`1c2e5b0`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/1c2e5b031845630a6f82501de51e1ae902d52559) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add M600 filament-swap color-change annotation (E9 phase 3, [#147](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/147), DD-009 D2).

  The parser now records a sparse `colorChanges` events channel on `ToolpathIR`
  (`{ x, y, z, segIndex, srcByte, tool }`, capability `colorChanges`) — `M600` is a marker with a
  position but no motion segment, captured in a side channel that leaves segment indices, scrub, and
  layer ranges untouched (mirrors the `retractions` channel from [#148](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/148)). Detection lives in the parser
  (where `M600` was previously discarded as `unsupported-command`), so a bare `M600` is honored even
  when no dialect is detected. A new `colorChange` renderer color mode shades segments by **swap slot**
  (the count of color changes at or before a segment) using the existing palette-index path — not the
  `tool` channel — so multi-material prints color by active filament across manual swaps. Capability-
  gated: offered only when the IR actually carries an `M600`. Exposed through the existing `colorMode`
  option, so all adapters and `renderStill` support it with no new prop.

  DD-009 D2 was amended (maintainer-approved) to move detection from the dialect layer to the parser
  and realize the "dedicated color-change channel" as this sparse events channel.

- [#170](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/170) [`d4c51a3`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/d4c51a394c1078efe959646b68f42de74e7cf4de) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add an orthographic camera option (E9 phase 2, [#150](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/150), DD-009 D3).

  The renderer now carries both a perspective and an orthographic camera and switches between them with
  `setCameraMode('perspective' | 'orthographic')`, surfaced as a `cameraMode` renderer/controller option
  (default `'perspective'`), a `cameraMode` prop on the Vue, React, and Svelte adapters, and a
  `renderStill` option. Toggling preserves the view direction, target, and apparent framing — the
  orthographic frustum is sized to the same half-height the perspective view frames — and OrbitControls
  follows the active camera. Orthographic (parallel) projection suits dimensional/technical inspection.

  The parser now records a sparse `retractions` events channel on `ToolpathIR`
  (`{ x, y, z, kind, srcByte, segIndex }`, capability `retractions`) — E-only retraction moves emit no
  segment, so they are captured positionally in a side channel that leaves segment indices, scrub, and
  layer ranges untouched. The renderer draws them as opt-in always-on-top markers (warm = retract, cool
  = unretract) via `setShowRetractions`, clipped by the current layer/scrub window and shown only when
  the IR actually carries events. Exposed as a `showRetractions` prop across the Vue, React, and Svelte
  adapters (default off).

- [#173](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/173) [`aceb9f2`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/aceb9f29091bec94f0de91791dd093ab0d92b834) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add a bounded declarative theming API (E9 phase 4, [#153](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/153), DD-009 D4).

  A small, stable `Theme` object — `background`, `gridColor`, `bedColor`, `hemisphereIntensity`,
  `directionalIntensity`, and a `materialPreset` (`'matte'` | `'glossy'`) — surfaced as a renderer
  `theme` option + `setTheme()`, a controller `renderer.theme` option + `controls.setTheme()`, a `theme`
  prop on the Vue/React/Svelte adapters, and a `theme` option on `renderStill` (so headless thumbnails
  theme identically). The public type is three-free (`ThemeColor = number | string`) and re-exported
  through `gcode-preview-core`, so it stays valid across `three` upgrades; deep customization keeps using
  the `createRenderer` / `raw.renderer()` escape hatches.

  Additive and opt-in — the defaults reproduce the existing look exactly, and `setTheme` uses replace
  semantics (omitted fields reset to their defaults). Semantic colors (progress/retraction markers,
  overlay ghost/band, and the origin tripod) are intentionally not themeable; the material preset affects
  tube (extrude) geometry only — lines-quality geometry is unlit.

### Minor Changes

- [#141](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/141) [`c26879f`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/c26879f4148b77e5e9070bc2ee421a265c9571d3) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - First published line of the Chestnut Labs G-code Preview stack (`v0.1.0`, DD-008): worker-based
  `.gcode` / `.gcode.3mf` parsing into a versioned `ToolpathIR`, cross-vendor dialect annotation
  (PrusaSlicer, Orca/Bambu, Cura, Klipper, Marlin, RepRap-flavor), a Three.js renderer with layer
  clipping, scrub, tubes, build plates and the honest live-progress overlay, a framework-neutral
  preview controller, and first-class Vue/React/Svelte adapters with capability parity.

- [#145](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/145) [`ab7db35`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/ab7db35b3fcc84da3f26c4b6fe91671470df05c5) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add `renderStill(source, options)` to `@chestnutlabs/gcode-preview-core`: a headless,
  non-interactive still-image entry point (DD-008 §4.8; the reusable capability behind AnyBridge's
  G-code thumbnail worker, [#791](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/791)). Accepts G-code bytes or a pre-parsed `ToolpathIR`, builds to
  completion, frames deterministically (or applies an explicit camera pose), and renders one frame
  to an `OffscreenCanvas` or DOM canvas for the caller to read back.

  `gcode-renderer-three` gains the supporting surface: `ToolpathRenderer` accepts an `OffscreenCanvas`
  render target (new `RenderTargetCanvas` type) and a `preserveDrawingBuffer` option for readable
  single-frame renders.
