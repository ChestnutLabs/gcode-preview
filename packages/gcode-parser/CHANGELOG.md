## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#171](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/171) [`1c2e5b0`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/1c2e5b031845630a6f82501de51e1ae902d52559) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add M600 filament-swap color-change annotation (E9 phase 3, [#147](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/147), DD-009 D2).

  The parser now records a sparse `colorChanges` events channel on `ToolpathIR`
  (`{ x, y, z, segIndex, srcByte, tool }`, capability `colorChanges`) — `M600` is a marker with a
  position but no motion segment, captured in a side channel that leaves segment indices, scrub, and
  layer ranges untouched (mirrors the `retractions` channel from [#148](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/148)). Detection lives in the parser
  (where `M600` was previously discarded as `unsupported-command`), so a bare `M600` is honored even
  when no dialect is detected. A new `colorChange` renderer color mode shades segments by **swap slot**
  (the count of color changes at or before a segment) using the existing palette-index path — not the
  `tool` channel — so multi-material prints color by active filament across manual swaps. Capability-
  gated: offered only when the IR actually carries an `M600`. Exposed through the existing `colorMode`
  option, so all adapters and `renderStill` support it with no new prop.

  DD-009 D2 was amended (maintainer-approved) to move detection from the dialect layer to the parser
  and realize the "dedicated color-change channel" as this sparse events channel.

- [#168](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/168) [`11c75bd`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/11c75bd540c1490f888ec9ecee64814cafb25156) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - Add opt-in retraction/deretraction markers (E9 phase 1, [#148](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/issues/148), DD-009 D1).

  The parser now records a sparse `retractions` events channel on `ToolpathIR`
  (`{ x, y, z, kind, srcByte, segIndex }`, capability `retractions`) — E-only retraction moves emit no
  segment, so they are captured positionally in a side channel that leaves segment indices, scrub, and
  layer ranges untouched. The renderer draws them as opt-in always-on-top markers (warm = retract, cool
  = unretract) via `setShowRetractions`, clipped by the current layer/scrub window and shown only when
  the IR actually carries events. Exposed as a `showRetractions` prop across the Vue, React, and Svelte
  adapters (default off).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#141](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/pull/141) [`c26879f`](https://github.com/ChestnutLabs/gcode-preview/commit/c26879f4148b77e5e9070bc2ee421a265c9571d3) Thanks [@sobechestnut-dev](https://github.com/sobechestnut-dev)! - First published line of the Chestnut Labs G-code Preview stack (`v0.1.0`, DD-008): worker-based
  `.gcode` / `.gcode.3mf` parsing into a versioned `ToolpathIR`, cross-vendor dialect annotation
  (PrusaSlicer, Orca/Bambu, Cura, Klipper, Marlin, RepRap-flavor), a Three.js renderer with layer
  clipping, scrub, tubes, build plates and the honest live-progress overlay, a framework-neutral
  preview controller, and first-class Vue/React/Svelte adapters with capability parity.
